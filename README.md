### 4) Setting Up the Database

This project utilizes MongoDB as its database. Follow these steps to set up the database:

1. **MongoDB Installation:**
   - Install MongoDB on your system. You can download it from the [official MongoDB website](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Start MongoDB Server:**
   - Once installed, start the MongoDB server. You can do this by running the `mongod` command in your terminal.

3. **Create a Database:**
   - Open a new terminal and run the `mongo` command to open the MongoDB shell.
   - Create a new database for the project. For example:
     ```shell
     use GoGrabDB
     ```

4. **Configure .env File:**
   - Open the `.env` file in the project's root directory.
   - Set the `MAIN_DB_URI` variable to the connection string for your MongoDB database. Example:
     ```env
     MAIN_DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/GoGrabDB
     ```
     
6. **Verify Connection:**
   - Ensure that the project's backend server connects successfully to the MongoDB database. Check the terminal/console for any connection errors.

By following these steps, you'll have the MongoDB database set up and configured for the GoGrab E-Commerce project. Adjust connection details and configurations according to your specific needs.

### 5) Setting Up the Project

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jawad-mohsin/GoGrab.git
   cd GoGrab
   ```
2. Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:
   ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
   ```
3. Start both data and auth servers:
   ```bash
    npm run start
    npm run authStart
   ```
4. Once both servers are running correctly, navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:
   ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
   ```
5. Start the frontend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Now, you have a perfectly working project.

## Environment Variables

This project relies on an `.env` file to securely store sensitive configuration details which is not included in the current repository. To set up the environment variables, follow these steps:

1. Create a file named `.env` in the project's root directory.

2. Populate the file with the following variables:

```env
AUTH_SERVER_PORT=
MAIN_SERVER_PORT=
MAIN_DB_URI=
SALT_ROUNDS=
CRYPTO_SECRET_KEY=
CRYPTO_ALGORITHM=
CRYPTO_IV_LENGTH=
SMTP_SERVICE=
SMTP_HOST=
